First, execute "WaterAirInteractionSimulation.exe". Once the process is complete, "pt_data_i" storing the position of particles at time step i will be created in the directory "data".

Then, execute "RenderingFluidParticles.exe". If you press 'r' after adjusting the view using your mouse (left-click: rotation, right-click: translation, both left- and right-click: scaling), you can render the scene. The resulting sequence of images are stored in the directory "img".
